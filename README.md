# FortressMG
the fun fortress, for those non-security servers.

## Beta Notice:

We do have a [beta](https://github.com/fortressbot/fortressmg/tree/beta) branch for people who want current features instead of waiting a week or potentially longer for pushes to come to the main branch. This is the same case with the regular Fortress repository, and it will also be the same case with this repository.

*If you want current features, stick with the beta repository. However, it is called beta for a reason. There may be some instabilities which will often be fixed same-day however.*
